HPC-BoyerMoore-OpenMP-MPI-MATLAB-CUDA
=====================================

Description:
The project was aimed to accelerate Boyer-Moore Horsepool Algorithm which is the most used String Matching Algorithm to find
a pattern within a given text. We employed various software & hardware techniques to extract parallelism and acceerate the 
string matching application. All the codes were run in Discovery Cluster. Information about the cluster can be find below.
